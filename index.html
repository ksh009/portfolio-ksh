              <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>
                I have hands-on proficiency with HTML, ensuring its structure
                follows SEO best practices and adheres closely to BEM
                conventions.

              <h3>CSS</h3>
              <p>
                Areas such as selectors, properties, values, cascading,
                specificity, box model, layouts (including Flexbox and CSS
                Grid), media queries, and animations are within my realm of
                expertise.

              <h3>Javascript</h3>
              <p>
                DOM manipulation, events and event listeners, asynchronous
                programming, error handling, API consumption, and other related
                areas are among my areas of expertise.

              <h3>React</h3>
              <p>
                Components and props, state and lifecycle, methods, conditional
                rendering, React Router, higher-order components, and other
                related areas are areas where I possess expertise.

              </div>
              <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
              <p>
                I have hands-on experience in using Bootstrap. It speeds up my
                workflow, and I do not need to think of class names as they are
                already provided. This is one of my favorite CSS frameworks.

              <h3>Tailwind CSS</h3>
              <p>
                I have recently started using Tailwind CSS in some of my
                personal projects and have really come to enjoy using it.
                Tailwind helps me keep my styling consistent.

              </div>
              <h3>Redux</h3>
              <p>
                I have hands-on experience with Redux. I like the fact that
                there is one centralized store for all my state. This makes
                tracking state easy via the Redux dev tools.
              </p>

              </div>
              <h3>Node js</h3>
              <p>
                I enjoy using Node.js to spin up web servers with Express. I
                have also built many backend solutions with Node.js, both in a
                professional capacity and on personal projects.

              </div>
              <h3>Postman</h3>
              <p>
                I always use Postman as a go-to for testing my Express APIs
                before implementing them client-side. It is very helpful when
                trying to visualize how the client-side will work eventually.

              </div>
              <h3>Mongo DB</h3>
              <p>
                I am well versed in performing CRUD operations using MongoDB.
                Mongoose is the ORM I use when implementing these operations. I
                have been using MongoDB for the past two years.

                />
              </div>
              <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
              <p>
                I have used PostgreSQL on my last client project. I can also
                perform CRUD operations using PostgreSQL. I have more experience
                using it with the Sequelize ORM.

              </div>
              <h3>Ethereum - Solidity</h3>
              <p>
                I can understand Solidity Smart Contracts, test them on Remix,
                use Hardhat.js to deploy them, and Ethers.js or Web3.js to build
                a UI on the client-side. I can also use Truffle.

              </div>
              <h3>AWS</h3>
              <p>
                I have hands-on experience with AWS Cognito for user management,
                S3 for simple object storage, API Gateway, and Lambda for
                serverless function deployment and API management.

              <h3>Firebase</h3>
              <p>
                I can use Firebase for authentication and user management. I use
                Firestore to perform CRUD operations. I have used Firebase in
                one of my latest personal projects called Bookworks (still a
                work in progress).

                  I've created a fun game using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
                  The objective is to match pairs of tiles. If two flipped tiles
                  don't match, they return to their default state. When all
                  pairs are successfully matched, the tiles disappear.
                  Additionally, the project features unit tests implemented with
                  React Testing Library.

            <h3>Full Stack JavaScript Developer</h3>
            <p>
              I'm Kyle, and I love building things on the web. Prior to web
              development, I worked as a junior accountant. I decided to
              transition to web development because I recognized the growing
              shift of businesses into the digital realm. With a strong interest
              in digital business, I am well-versed in e-commerce. I enjoy
              analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of online businesses, and I
              could spend hours delving into e-commerce or crypto-related
              metrics. I am fully proficient in the MERN stack and possess
              experience with various other web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose web development as a way to channel all the skills I've
              acquired into a single domain. Blockchain dApp development is a
              path I am keenly pursuing, as I wholeheartedly believe in the
              potential of decentralized finance. I am looking forward to
              connecting with you. Best regards, Kyle.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-h2">Professional Experience</h3>
            <hr class="main__about--hr" />
            <div>
              <h4>Company: Techadon Technologies</h4>
              <h4>Role: Junior Full Stack Developer</h4>
              <h4>Start Date: February 14 to December 1, 2022</h4>
            </div>
            <hr class="main__about--hr" />
            <p>
              At Techadon, my role was multifaceted, encompassing client-side
              responsibilities such as implementing features like Authentication
              using AWS Cognito and Amplify. The application's primary objective
              was to leverage decentralized technologies like Ethers.js and the
              Ethereum blockchain to create a decentralized wallet solution. The
              core web app focused on wallet-related functionalities, including
              sending, receiving, and viewing the balance. I was responsible for
              implementing these basic wallet features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I built an admin dashboard for managing KYC
              submissions. One of the highlights of this task was implementing
              graphs using Chart.js and Apex Charts libraries. To populate these
              graphs with relevant data, I utilized data providers like
              CoinGecko and various others.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the server-side, my responsibilities included managing user
              wallet creation, user transactions, and user sending. I used
              PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for these tasks. Furthermore, I
              developed KYC upload routes using Express and Node.js, along with
              gathering market data. I also worked on logic that interacts with
              the Uniswap API and existing stablecoin smart contracts, such as
              USDT and DAI.

              Passionate and innovative Full Stack Developer undergoing a
              transformative 12-month learnership at Umuzi. With a focus on
              full-stack programming (Systems Development), I've successfully
              completed a comprehensive curriculum comprising 91 projects within
              7 months (2 Months before the recommended deadline). This rigorous
              program emphasizes a peer-reviewed approach, ensuring that each
              project attains the highest standard of competence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout this dynamic learnership, I've gained an in-depth
              proficiency on a range of technologies, including but not limited
              to the PERN and MERN stack, and much more. My proficiency has been
              validated through a series of Coderbyte-style algorithm tests,
              where I've achieved a level two proficiency thus far.
            </p>
            <p>
              The curriculum also includes a design thinking project, providing
              hands-on experience in creating an MVP using Figma. My aptitude
              for design thinking was further demonstrated in a collaborative
              group project that successfully addressed real-world challenges.

              <h4>Company: Momentum Metropolitan Holdings Limited</h4>
              <h4>Role: Web Developer Intern</h4>

            <hr class="main__about--hr" />
            <p>
              I created Sequence Diagrams and Component Diagrams to visualize
              interactions and system structure. I designed API input/output
              samples using Swagger for POST and GET requests in JSON format and
              documented API designs with JSON samples in markdown.
              Additionally, I created UI mock designs using Figma and expanded
              my API design knowledge with custom methods in Swagger. I also set
              up shared repositories for Wiremock and UI projects on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my testing phase, I created mock scenarios and spun up a mock
              server in a Docker container. I verified GET and POST interactions
              and created unit tests in Postman. Following this, I built the UI
              using Angular based on feedback, consumed data from GET requests,
              and implemented filtering and search functionality. I updated UI
              logic and researched best practices for unit testing in Angular.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my AWS Solutions Architect training, I completed sections
              covering Availability Zones, IAM, EC2, ELB, RDS, S3, and other AWS
              services, discussing high availability, scalability, and security
              aspects of AWS. To streamline the deployment process, I set up
              auto-build processes using GitHub Actions and containerized the
              Angular application, creating Docker Compose files for concurrent
              backend and frontend deployment. Furthermore, I researched and
              implemented Ory Hydra as an Identity Provider for user
              authentication and authorization.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Achievements:</h4>
            <p>
              I developed and tested mock APIs and UIs using Docker, Wiremock,
              and Postman. I containerized applications for efficient
              deployment, integrated backend services, and implemented secure
              authentication methods. I demonstrated a comprehensive
              understanding of AWS Solutions Architecture.
